# UHCC_Imua_Arliss_2018

This repository contains code that was used to pilot the UHCC ARLISS 2018 quadcopter and is designed for autonomous flight, not for remote controll, but can be adapted to take inputs from a controller.

## Getting Started

All code assumes you are using the same quadcopter components.

- Little Bee 30A ESC
  - signal on pins 10, 11, 12, 13
- Feather M0 Adalogger
- Adafruit 10-DOF IMU Breakout - L3GD20H + LSM303 + BMP180
- Adafruit Ultimate GPS v3
- a voltage divider on pin A0
  - resistor 1: 14.7kOhms
  - resistor 2: 4/7kOhms
- a dead trigger ( pull-up ) on pin 9

*all other components are user prefference

Other Components used specifically for the UHCC ARLISS quadcopter.
- 5x3 in props

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
